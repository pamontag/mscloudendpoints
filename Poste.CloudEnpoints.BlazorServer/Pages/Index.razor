<h1>Microsoft Cloud Endpoints</h1>

<p>If certain IP address ranges or individual IP addresses are blocked in the environment, users may not be able to reach Microsoft Cloud environments. Blocked IPs can also impact connecting Dynamics 365 and Office 365 apps.</p>
<p>The purpose of this portal is to have a central entry point for getting updates information about cloud endpoints to be accessible from customer networks.</p>
